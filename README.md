The quiz app was developed focusing on the `useReducer` hook with the below concepts:<br>
✅ Various states (most of which are dependent on each other) are managed centrally using the `useReducer` hook<br>
✅ Data (quiz questions) is fetched from a fake api (using `json-server`)<br>
✅ Time-bound quiz (30 seconds for each question), using `setInterval`, `clearInterval` JS functions and `useEffect` hook<br>

### Run the app
`npm start` which will open the UI at `http://localhost:3000`<br>
`npm run server` which will run the fake api using `json-server`<br>

### Branches info
`master` branch contains the final code for the project.<br>
`project-1-... , project-2-... , project-3-....` depict the branches in order.<br>
